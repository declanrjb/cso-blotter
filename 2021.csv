The CSO explained that while dogs were allowed off-leash in the off-leash area, the dog needed to be under the owner’s control and thus safe and friendly toward other dogs and people. The dog’s owner stated that people uncomfortable around dogs should not walk near the off-leash area, and the CSO reminded the dog owner that this off-leash area is bordered by the Studio Art and DOJO buildings that needed to be accessible to the Reed community.
